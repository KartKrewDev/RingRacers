# Have you already searched the issue tracker for issues similar to yours? 

(Use the search bar on https://gitlab.com/kart-krew-dev/ring-racers/-/issues - duplicate reports make it tough for us to keep track of things.)

# What version of Ring Racers are you playing?

(Replace this text with the version number. You can see this on the title screen at the bottom-left corner.)

# What is the fastest way to trigger the bug?

(Bugs that can't be reproduced are extremely hard to fix. If you can't make it happen on demand, try and describe the circumstances where it triggers.)

# What is the bugged behavior? 

(Describe what happens when you encounter the bug.)

# What do you expect to happen instead?

(Describe what should be happening instead of the bugged behavior.)

# Logs, videos, or screenshots that showcase the issue

(For crash bugs, look for an .RPT file, or your `latest-log.txt`. For gameplay glitches or oddities, try to attach a replay or video that contains the issue (check `media/replay`, or hit F9 in-game to start recording). You can drag files directly into this window.)
